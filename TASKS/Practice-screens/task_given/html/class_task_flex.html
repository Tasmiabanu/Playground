                        Textileworkers are exposed to airborne particulate from natural and synthetic fibrous materials in their
                        work<br>
                        environment. Exposure to cotton dust in the textile industry has been associated with several work-specific <br>
                        non-specific respiratory symptoms. Cotton dust is often contaminated with Gram-neagtive bacteria , which<br>
                        contain endotoxins in their outer cell wall. Some studies suggested that endotoxin is the major cause for the dust
                       agent in the adversa effects associated.Exposure to cotton dust and endotoxin has been implicated in the<br>
                       aetilogy of nuber of diseases, including chronic pulmonary disease with nasal and ocular irritation.
