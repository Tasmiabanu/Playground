            textile<br>
            workers and other personal understand and practice good basic hygiene habits, including proper hand
            washing,<br>
            on regular basis. The FDA cited poor personal hygiene and improper hand washing as<br>
            the third most important cause of illness.This report also cited that 93% of outbreaks related to textile handiers<br>
        involved sick workers which include improper giove use and eating while on job</b></p>

        <p class="div">Textileworkers are exposed to airborne particulate from natural and synthetic fibrous materials in their
            work<br>
            environment. Exposure to cotton dust in the textile industry has been associated with several work-specific <br>
            non-specific respiratory symptoms. Cotton dust is often contaminated with Gram-neagtive bacteria , which<br>
            contain endotoxins in their outer cell wall. Some studies suggested that endotoxin is the major cause for the dust
           agent in the adversa effects associated.Exposure to cotton dust and endotoxin has been implicated in the<br>
           aetilogy of nuber of diseases, including chronic pulmonary disease with nasal and ocular irritation.
